                    | Jon is none other than my Dad. He's always been there for me and in so many ways really is my
                    | best man. We've had more than our fair share of great days. From misadventures at the top of
                    | Yosimite Falls to seeing State beat Carolina for the fifth year in a row I'm glad I was blessed
                    | with him as a father. And now I get to have him by my side as I start the biggest adventure of
                    | my life!

                    | when I needed it. I'm glad to call him my brother. As the rest of our lives begin I can't wait
                    | for all the shenanigans that will surely follow!

                    | know him over these past couple years. Hopefully we'll have many more Christmas mornings to experience
                    | together.

                    | Bradley and I have known each other since birth, largely because our parents are such close
                    | friends. When my family and I moved away from Wake Forest we naturaly ended up going somewhat separate
                    | ways, but every time our family's get back together its always a great time catching up!
