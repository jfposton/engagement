                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan and Taylor met in 6th grade at Currituck 
                    County Middle School when they sat next to each other in English class. Jonathan was extremely 
                    shy and Taylor was determined to get him to speak to her by the end of the school year. After 
                    much prodding, she finally got her way when they were able to talk about a common interest, 
                    Battle of the Books. They continued to make small talk and become friends throughout middle school
                    and in 9th grade, they both joined the Currituck Marching Knights. Jonathan played trumpet and
                    Taylor was in the colorguard. They spent a lot of time together during marching season and became
                    very close friends until eventually, they developed a crush on each other. Luckily, they had a 
                    friend named Michelle that refused to let their feelings go unnoticed and declared them in a 
                    relationship (though Jonathan did also bring her a Hershey kiss with a plume that said "Be Mine").
                    They dated for several months until marching band ended for the season and they "drifted apart". Although
                    they broke up, they still remained the best of friends over the next several years of high school and college.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan and Taylor stayed best friends throughout their 
                    first years of college. Taylor was attending UNCW at the time and Jonathan was at NC State. During 
                    Christmas break of their sophomore year, Jonathan and Taylor spent a lot of time together with several
                    groups of friends. During what seemed to be an average day with Taylor's best friend Mallory and Jonathan's
                    best friend Tyler, Jonathan "made a move" on Taylor by putting his arm around her while watching the NCSU 
                    basketball game. Ultimately, this was the beginning of their soon-to-be relationship. They began "talking" 
                    and quickly developed feelings for each other as more than just each other's best friend. Jonathan and Taylor
                    returned to school and came home two weeks later to go on their first real date. He asked Taylor to be his 
                    girlfriend that night, January 19, 2013. From then on, they were attached at the hip and fell more in love 
                    every day.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next two years, Jonathan and Taylor spent as much time
                    together as they could. As many weekends as possible, Jonathan travelled to Greenville (as Taylor had 
                    transferred to ECU) or Taylor drove to Raleigh to spend time together. They went on many dates and had lots
                    of fun times travelling and just being together. For their final spring break as college students, they 
                    decided that they wanted to go on a trip. Taylor's aunt and uncle were planning a trip to Orlando, FL at about
                    the same time and offered for them to come along. Because Taylor had never been to Disney World, they decided 
                    to visit! Little did Taylor know, Jonathan had more than just an average visit up his sleeve. He made reservations
                    for them to have breakfast with Winnie-the-Pooh (Taylor's favorite) much to her excitement! They attended the 
                    breakfast and Jonathan said that they should go ahead and get a picture in front of the castle before the park 
                    got too busy. Taylor handed her camera to the photographer and posed for what she didn't realize was "the decoy
                    picture". Jonathan then turned to Taylor and told her that in the happiest place on Earth, he would like her to 
                    make him the happiest man on Earth. He got down on one knee and asked Taylor to be his wife and presented her with
                    the most beautiful ring she'd ever seen. Of course, she said yes!

                                        My favorite moment with Taylor is a really hard question. Of course our trip to Disney World was a really good time. 
                                        But honestly anytime where we I get to make her laugh and smile is the new best day. I know it's cheesy but its the truth.

                                                    There’s no space between our hearts <br/>
                                                    And this day, I choose to keep loving you <br/>
                                                    As if it were a choice, I can’t stop falling in love

                                                    She's reading from a chapter<br />
                                                    that she sometimes calls her own <br />
                                                    And now she's taken over me<br />
                                                    This girl I once rejected<br />
                                                    Has now become the girl of my dreams

                                                    But if I can love her like you do<br />
                                                    It's all she needs<br />

                                                    I haven't found the remedy<br />
                                                    For every tear she'll cry<br />
                                                    But I'll try to be the one who's by her side<br />
